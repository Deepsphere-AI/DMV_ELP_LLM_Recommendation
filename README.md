## DMV California License Plate Validation - Profanity Check
  A tool based on ChatGPT and Google's PaLM
## Introduction
  This repository houses a profanity validation tool for California DMV license plates. The tool leverages advanced large language models, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's PaLM, to categorize and filter profanity under categories such as obscene, toxic, insult, hate, severe toxic, and threat. The goal is to create a more civil and respectful environment on our roads by preventing the registration of offensive or inappropriate license plates.
